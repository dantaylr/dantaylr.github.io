Carbon Recipe

In the interest of spreading awareness about carbon emissions and a desire to bring a deeper fulfilling value to our everyday decisions, I created a [web application](https://carbonrecipe.netlify.app/) that would allow the average person to easily see and experiment with their carbon footprint. 

After using many emissions calculators I was faced with difficult questions involving locating my gas and electricity bills and making numerical estimates that I couldn't easily conjure up on the spot. Many calculators just spat out a number at the end of a lengthy questionnaire and told you to do things like use reusable bags and pay for carbon offsets.

I wanted something that immedietly showed me the heavy hitters behind my own impact and encouraged me to experiment.

The app was originally prototyped using a massive spreadsheet with calculations pulled from meticulous searches, verified databases, and ChatGPT (I promise it was accurate).

Users can customize their own recipe, which is saved to their browser's local storage. They can also share their recipe using a code that is dynamically generated in the URL bar.
