<p>Cover art and video production for the Nerds Trying To Dance EP by <a href="https://pedestriantactics.com">Pedestrian Tactics</a> released on Mad Zoo Records</p>
<p>The EP was highly inspired by vocal fans who actively listened to my music while coding</p>

<p>A series of videos was developed to tease the release of each track on the EP using a mash of screen recordings from a Windows 95 emulator</p>
