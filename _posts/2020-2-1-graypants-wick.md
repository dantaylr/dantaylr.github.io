Design, branding, photography, and manufacturing coordination for [Graypants](https://graypants.com) debut entry into the portable light market. Since its release it was featured in [Dezeen](https://www.dezeen.com/2020/12/02/graypants-wick-lighting-dezeen-showroom/), [Design Milk](https://design-milk.com/our-favorite-candlelight-is-now-available-in-new-modern-shades/), and many other fantastic blogs and shops. My friend found them at Molbaks.

A detailed breakdown of the project is on my [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/164180685/Wick).

In addition to scultping the CAD portion of the product itself I built accurate rendering environments to simulate differences in material finishes and light temperatures.
