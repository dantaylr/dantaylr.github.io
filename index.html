            <p>I design new and interesting experiences across a wide variety of media, utilizing a constantly
                expanding toolset and connections with other wonderful and talented people.

                My design of the Graypants Wick was featured in Wirecutter's "28 of the Best Housewarming Gifts" and is a
                great example of my favorite kind of multi-faceted design effort, as I sculpted the product itself, designed the
                packaging and collateral, conducted user tests, and performed product photography and renderings.

            I currently operate a design and electronic music brand called <a

            contracts.
